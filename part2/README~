I have completed all requirements of Part 1 and Part 2 of assignment 2.

Please note - I have only implemented checksum validation for TCP packets because thats what the assignment said

The code compiles and runs without errors or warnings on the eniac machine.

I have added comments in my code to explain different steps.


An example of the running the code is - 

#####@eniac:~/ns> make

#####@eniac:~/ns> python packetparser.py <filename>

#####@eniac:~/ns> python packetparser.py <filename> -t
