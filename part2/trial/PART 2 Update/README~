I have completed all requirements of Part 1 and Part 2 of assignment 2.

Please note - I have only implemented checksum validation for TCP packets because thats what the assignment said

The code compiles and runs without errors or warnings on the eniac machine.

I have added comments in my code to explain different steps.


An example of the running the code is - 

#####@eniac:~/ns> make

#####@eniac:~/ns> python packetparser.py <filename>

#####@eniac:~/ns> python packetparser.py <filename> -t


"""""CHANGES FROM Previous submission"""""

KYLE AS I HAD SPOKEN TO YOU BEFORE I ADDED THESE LINES TO MY PREVIOUS PART 2 SUBMISSION IN THE FILE packetparser.py

In the function "process_packet_from_init":

        if not len(current_connection.s_noAck) == 0:
            for i in range(len(current_connection.s_noAck)):
                if packet.seq == current_connection.s_noAck[i].seq:
                    del current_connection.s_noAck[i:]
                    break

In the function "process_packet_from_resp":

	if not len(current_connection.d_noAck) == 0:
            for i in range(len(current_connection.d_noAck)):
                if packet.seq == current_connection.d_noAck[i].seq:
                    del current_connection.d_noAck[i:]
                    break                  
                    
Both these blocks of code are similar and handle the same end case (one for the packets from the initiator and other for the packets from respnder.
