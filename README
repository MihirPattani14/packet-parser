I have completed all requirements of Part 1 of assignment 2.

Please note - I have only implemented checksum validation for TCP packets because thats what the assignment said

The code compiles and runs without errors or warnings on the eniac machine.

I have added comments in my code to explain different steps.

TO RUN the code please enter the following:

	make

	./packetparse <file_name>

An example of the above implentation is - 

#####@eniac:~/ns> make

#####@eniac:~/ns> ./packetparse smtp.pcap


The assignment asks us to run the file only as a commmand packetparse.
But to make packetparse a command we need sudo privileges.

The output is in the following form -

_____________________________________________

	Packet Number: 59
_____________________________________________

Packet Type:	|	TCP
MAC src:	|	00:1f:33:d9:81:600
MAC dest:	|	00:e0:1c:3c:17:c2
IP src:		|	74:53:140:153 
IP dest:	|	10:10:1:4
Src port:	|	25
Dest port:	|	1470
Checksum:	|	8545
Validity:	|	Valid Checksum
Payload :	|	6




Also at the end of the output there are general stats about the pcap file-
